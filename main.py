#Things to add:
So...kinda big problem. we dont want to delete and redraw the item each time when we can
just modify the points. 
We create a container for each segment that holds its line, cylinder,cube etc...We then specifically
modify these segments
#Current Bugs:
#The cylinder should overlap the lines not the other way around
